## Reverse Engineering Process

To interact with the Dynatab75x screen, we reverse-engineered the USB communication protocol used by the stock driver software. This was done using the following steps:

### 1. Packet Capture with Wireshark

- We monitored USB traffic while using the official Epomaker driver software to upload an image.
- Captured the raw packet data sent to the device.

### 2. Pattern Deduction

- We created simple, known test images (e.g., solid red, green, or blue) to observe how the pixel data was structured in the packets.
- This allowed us to correlate byte patterns with specific pixel positions and values on the 60x9 display.

### 3. Reimplementation

- Based on the packet structure, we built a Python interface to encode images into the correct format.
- These packets were then sent directly to the device using the `hidapi` library.

## Animation Support

- Animations work similarly to image uploads.
- Each frame must be encoded and sent sequentially as raw pixel data.
- Timing and sequencing are managed manually to give the appearance of motion.

## Legal Notice

This project is the result of independent reverse engineering efforts conducted for interoperability purposes.  
All analysis was performed on locally captured USB packets generated by interactions between the official software and hardware.  
No decompilation or unauthorized access to proprietary code or firmware was used.
